## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.

* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the affected code.
* Pull requests affecting .md files must be approved by one team member
* All other pull requests must be approved by two members
