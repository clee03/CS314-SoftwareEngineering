# Sprint 5 - T17 - TBD

## Goal

### Reliable first release with clean code!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v5.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>5.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* #212 - Online map with pan and zoom
* #213 - Clean code
* #216 - Test coverage

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* #126 - Select a starting location: We focused on the other epics and issues associated with those epics and did not have time to complete this one. 

#### What went well
* The team as a whole did a good job completing issues and working together/talking through how to solve them. 

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* We struggled with sickness and one of the team members laptops breaking this sprint.  Three opt was also very difficult to get working but we were able to finally analyze the data and get it working.
