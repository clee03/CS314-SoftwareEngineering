# T17 Retrospective for Sprint 1

Area | What we did well | What we need to work on | What we will change
:--- | :------- | :--------- | :---------------------
**Teamwork** | We were all willing to meet as many times as we needed to in order to complete the sprint. We were able to talk through and help solve issues each of us had during each meeting. | We need to work on collaborating more as a team on each part of the sprints instead of lone wolfing the individual parts and then trying to pull it all together at the end.  | We will have more of an open line of communication when we are not together.
**Process** | We tried to make sure deadlines were hit early and that everyone understood their parts of the sprint. | We need to work on immediately merging to master after each pull request has gotten 2 team member reviews. | What we will do better is work on meeting personal deadlines.
**Tools** | We quickly learned the basics of the tools that were given and helped eachother understand how to use them. | We need to work on having a deeper understanding of all the different tools so that each of us are able to utilize them more in the next  sprints. | We will do our own research into the tools we are using and find a better tool to communicate with.
