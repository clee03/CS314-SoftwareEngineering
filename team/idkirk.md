1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?
- I respond to text / messenger the most whenever I'm not busy
- I check email about 5 times a day

2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
- I expect to have a program that we're all proud of. 

3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
- I need to get better with GitHub. Otherwise it shouldn't be hard communicating with the team.
  It'd be cool to at least hang out and talk about non-computer science stuff with everyone just to get to know them.

4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
- Time constraints and unforseen events. Hopefully I don't crash my motorcycle, but I'm not promising.

5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
- We throw them to the sarlac. 

6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
- We should be working as a team. If someone spends a lot more time optimizing I don't see a problem. 
  Just as long as everyone communicates what's happening. 

7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
- SO like, at least 12 minutes a week? (I see 8-12 hours per week, especially once it gets going.)

8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
- Trial by combat, pick from a hat, or team meetings. Whatever works.

9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
- They let the group know they're struggling if they're not done a minimum of a couple days in advance. 

10. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
- We have the work appraised by a professional.  

11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
- Creativley. Plan at meetings. Invest in RedBull. #sponsorship

12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
- Meet at least a few times out of class per strech, no specific time every week. Even if it's at a bar.

13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
- minimum 3 times per strech. Otherwise messenger is fine. 
- however, I still want to meet a couple of other times, either just to hang out or get lunch. 

14. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
- Depends on the size of the decision. You should always get one person's approval at least.

15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
- Set up pros and cons. 

16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
- If it works, it works. If it doesn't, tell them to chill. 

17. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
- guess I keep facilitating then. I don't really see this happening though.
