Questionare Answers:
1. its is best to communicate with me via text during the day or call me after 3 pm any day
2. I expect my team to work hard and give strong attempts at achieving every goal and attempt
to work to every standard.
3. I namely plan on working on my presentation skills for scrum meetings, and to develop good
commenting practices.
4. I have a tendency to do rather than to help teach others meaning i might put in a
disproportionate amount of work leading to inconsistencies. In addition i tend to
procrastinate and ignore problems until the deadlines.
5. For my style of work people should work for the standards (b) and if people want higher
grades they can work for the extra, but it is unreasonable to expect others to work extra
when they are unable to.
6. referring to 5) yes this is acceptable as ‘b’ is what is expected from students in the course.
7. I am unsure of this as i do not have project specifications but 6ish hours sounds like a good
mark to shoot for.
8. Work distribution should be based on individual skill sets and should be discussed as a
group before anyone starts on a specific sprint.
9. A group meeting should be called before any significant time is missed and the team should
be able to compensate for the difference. I leave the repercussions to the group to decide i
have no opinion on this.
10. I would prefer if the higher quality of work was ensured however if the work is likely worthy of
an average grade that should be considered sufficient for the person assigned to this task.
11. this should be considered during the scrum meetings and appropriate measures should be
taken. for example for myself as a procrastinator i will set earlier deadlines that i treat as
concrete so as to ensure work is done in a timely manner.
12. This should like the smartest way to plan out sprints and get the most out of what cs 314 is
all about. Tuesdays and Thursdays after 3 work best for me.
13. I am hoping for a minimum of once a week.
14. for major design decisions this should be the case. however for pull requests 2 other team
members should be sufficient.
15. even if adequate reasoning is given but the team still disagrees the group should go with the
majority.
16. In order to get the most out of this class each team member should participate to a large
degree however this standard may change depending on the person, but assuming each
person is participating I would be ok with it.
17. Call a meeting with just the team and assuming that fails call a meeting with the professor to
discuss reasonable solutions.
